## Overview

This platform allows multiple users to collaboratively evaluate and modify fashion designs, with AI technology assisting in completing these designs based on collective user input. The system provides tools for object recognition, texture rendering, 3D modeling, and pattern extraction.

## Key Features

### 1. Collective Design Creation
- **Design Proposal**: Present initial designs to users
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can provide feedback simultaneously
- **AI-Powered Synthesis**: Combine inputs from various users into cohesive designs

### 2. AI Design Tools
- **Object Detection**: Identify clothing items within images
- **Texture Rendering**: Apply and modify textures to clothing objects
- **3D Model Application**: Visualize designs on virtual models and avatars
- **Pattern Extraction**: Generate clothing patterns from silhouettes

### 3. Smart Evaluation System
- **Collect User Feedback**: Gather ratings and specific evaluations
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze user comments and suggestions
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Generate AI suggestions based on collective input

### 4. Blockchain Integration
- **NFT Support**: Create unique tokens for designs
- **Secure User Verification**: Track user contributions through blockchain
- **Transparent Attribution**: Maintain clear ownership records

## Technical Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React.js with Material-UI
- **Backend API**: Express.js and Node.js
- **AI Services**: Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Database**: MongoDB for user data and design information
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io for collaborative features
- **Blockchain Integration**: Web3.js for NFT and verification

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
