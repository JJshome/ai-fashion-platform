# AI Fashion Platform

A modern platform leveraging artificial intelligence to enable collective design creation and evaluation in fashion. This project is based on a patent filed by Ucaretron Inc.

## Overview

This platform allows multiple users to collaboratively evaluate and modify fashion designs, with AI technology assisting in completing these designs based on collective user input. The system provides tools for object recognition, texture rendering, 3D modeling, and pattern extraction.

## Key Components

### 1. Design Proposal Component (디자인 제안부)
- Presents fashion designs to multiple users
- Displays AI-generated designs based on user evaluations
- Supports real-time updates of modified designs

### 2. Evaluation Input Component (평가 입력부)
- Allows multiple users to evaluate fashion designs
- Provides AI-powered design tools for users to modify designs
- Supports NFT/blockchain integration for user information

#### AI Design Tools:
- **Object Detection**: Identifies clothing objects within images
- **Transformation**: Segments and binarizes detected objects
- **Rendering**: Sets textures for transformed objects
- **Model Application**: Applies 3D images to models or avatars
- **AI Pattern Extraction**: Creates clothing patterns from silhouettes using AI

### 3. AI Design Completion Component (인공지능 디자인 완성부)
- Completes clothing designs using AI based on user evaluations
- Reflects real-time modifications in the design
- Learns from user preferences and design patterns

### 4. Design Display Component (디자인 개시부)
- Presents completed designs individually to each user
- Tailors display based on user preferences

## Technical Features

- **Collective Intelligence**: Leverages opinions from multiple users to create optimal designs
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Updates designs in real-time as users provide feedback
- **AI-powered Tools**: Provides sophisticated tools for design modification
- **3D Visualization**: Supports 3D modeling and avatar application
- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses NFT/blockchain for user verification and information management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
